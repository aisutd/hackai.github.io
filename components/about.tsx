          Today, artificial intelligence is a buzzword thatâ€™s continuously mentioned. Still, many
          students are unaware of what it means, the subtopics within the field, and how they can
          get started and nurture their interests, especially beginners. We hope to take the mystery
          out of this specialized niche in computer science and bring it forward to students through
          a hackathon dedicated to featuring AI-related material. We aim for our virtual event to
          provide both learning and competition opportunities and connect them to professionals who
          can further guide them in their AI journey.

        <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
          HackAI is a student-run annual hackathon organized by the Artificial Intelligence Society
          at The University of Texas of Dallas, aiming to connect today&apos;s students with the
          knowledge and resources needed to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) related projects in
          the span of 24 hours. Topics such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data
          Analytics, and more will be represented amongst these projects, and we are confident that
          both the creativity and quality of the submissions will be incredibly high. The hackathon
          encompasses various levels of competition tasks, designed to challenge students while
          providing value to sponsors.
