                <h3>Mission behind HackAI</h3>
                <p>
                  Today, artificial intelligence is a buzzword thatâ€™s continuously 
                  mentioned. Still, many students are unaware of what it means, the
                  subtopics within the field, and how they can get started and nurture
                  their interests, especially beginners. We hope to take the mystery 
                  out of this specialized niche in computer science and bring it forward
                  to students through a hackathon dedicated to featuring AI-related material.
                  We aim for our virtual event to provide both learning and competition
                  opportunities and connect them to professionals who can further guide 
                  them in their AI journey.

                <p>
                  <!-- <ul> -->
                    HackAI is a student-run annual hackathon organized by the Artificial Intelligence 
                      Society at The University of Texas of Dallas, aiming to connect today's students with 
                      the knowledge and resources needed to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) related projects 
                      in the span of 24 hours. <br><br>
                    Topics such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and more 
                      will be represented amongst these projects, and we are confident that both the creativity 
                      and quality of the submissions will be incredibly high. The hackathon encompasses various 
                      levels of competition tasks, designed to challenge students while providing value to sponsors.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          </header>
          <div class="question-wrapper">
            <h3 class="question"><strong>How will HackAI work?</strong></h3>
            <p class="answer">Participants will be able to form teams of up to 5, 
              and can choose from a pool of standard or wildcard challenges provided by 
              sponsors, and submit their projects for a chance at winning one of our many prizes! 
              Throughout the hackathon, we will also have video game tournaments, workshops and events 
              from partner organizations, and chances to connect with our sponsors and recruiters. </p>
          </div>


          <div class="question-wrapper">
            <h3 class="question"><strong>Standard Challenges</strong></h3>
            <p class="answer">While AIS will incorporate competition challenges of our own, we highly encourage 
              our challenge sponsors to bring a unique AI challenge to the table. It could potentially be themed 
              by the mission of the company, a specific domain, a pressing global issue, etc. The challenge should 
              make the hackers critically and ethically think of solutions pertaining to the problem at hand. All 
              competitions currently will only support supervised machine learning tasks. Major challenges are designed 
              to be larger, 24-hour tasks with a larger prize pool, while minor challenges are smaller, 8-hour competitions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="question-wrapper">
            <h3 class="question"><strong>Wildcard Challenges</strong></h3>
            <p class="answer">The major and minor wildcard challenges come into place when one wants to break from the norm. 
              The wildcard system helps account for the fact that not all sponsors may wish to have their competition be a 
              supervised learning task, and gives them the flexibility of providing a different type of competition challenge. 
              In this wildcard pool, companies will be responsible for providing their own judges for challenges as well as prizes 
              limited to one winning team.</p>
